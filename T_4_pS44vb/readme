This is a mock Social Media website project I've created in the IT Bootcamp course.
Technologies used are: HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, BOOSTRAP AND JAVASCRIPT.
Project is not complete and will receive updates

Current functionalities are:
1. register account
2. log in/log out
3. create/edit user profile
4. follow other users
5. reset password

Index.php is the main file! open it in the browser and test the website! :)
